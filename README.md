# Prediction by partial matching - PPMC

PPM is an adaptive statistical data compression technique based on context 
modeling and prediction. PPM models use a set of previous symbols in the 
uncompressed symbol stream to predict the next symbol in the stream.
This code is a project for the discipline: Introduction to Information Theory, in the 
Federal University of Paraiba, Brazil.
